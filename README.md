# Instructions for Mechanical Turk Tasks:

If you own a car, chances are you've experienced awful service at a dealership or dealer service department. We have extracted over _5000 complaints_ using our newest tools, which we hope will improve how dealers interact with customers. We know that these people are dissatisfied. But are they specifically mentioning their dissatisfaction with their experienced wait-time?

#####Here’s what we want to know:
1. In each of these posts, is the author specifically dissatisfied with the speed of service? Said another way, Do they believe they waited for too long?
2. If so, how long do you think they had to wait?

We need your help answering both questions with one drop-down selection and a justification textbox. 

In the past we have accepted over 99 percent of HIT assignments, and maintain a similar policy as our other campaigns:
If you leave the justification box blank, put in a 3-word response or less, or otherwise do not provide an argument for your decision on the dropdown selection, we will reject the HIT. 

## Dropdown and Justification box
###Select the best option from the drop down menu and explain your choice in the justification box*; argue why your categorization should be the correct label. Please don’t restate what time length you chose- we have your choice from the dropdown data. 

Here are actual examples from the dataset. Read these examples to get an idea of what our thoughts are on labeling:

#Dropdown Choices, with examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

####Author does NOT appear to be dissatisfied with their wait time.
_Example author text_

  ```"the parts they installed weren’t fully screwed in, and I had to argue with them to fix it"```

Justification: Did not specifically mention time or waiting in the text.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

####Author dissatisfied with wait-time, but is ambiguous about the amount of time.
_Example author text_

  ```"... Not make me wait for so long be faster"``` and ```"not make people wait so long"``` and ```"they did a terrible job and it was a waste of my time"```

Justification: There were no clues to estimate their wait time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

####Author has waited closest to 45 minutes:
_Example author text_

  ```"...  nobody greeted me upon arrival. After 5 minutes, someone who seemed to be a mechanic greeted me. After that I waited around 15 minutes to speak to an adviser... "```

Justification: They specifically mentioned a sum of 20 minutes of wait time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

####Author has waited closest to four hours
_Example author text_
å
  ```"... The sun-visor was supposed to be replaced but was never installed due to the part not arriving. It was a complete waste of my time and a Saturday morning."```
Justification: Doesn’t seem like a full day because they were done by midday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

####Author has waited for more than one day
_Example author text_

  ```"... He then told me that I would have to bring the car back because he need to get something approved which would have to wait until Monday... "```

Justification: Waiting until Monday suggests at least a day of waiting on the dealership
